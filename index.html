    <h2>Welcome to the Real College Experience!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Miami University, where the leaves are pretty, the squirrels are aggressive, and the party scene is
      legendary! Here at Miami, we pride ourselves on our rich academic traditions, scenic campus, and, of course our
      thriving culture of binge drinking and casual drug use. Sure, substance abuse is a serious issue, but
      we prefer to look the other way while our students "find themselves". Why crack
      down on the fun
      when we can keep up appearances and maintain our pristine image as the "Ivy of the Midwest"? So, come join us in
      Oxford, where you can earn your degree while perfecting the art of partying. Welcome to Miami, where we truly
      prepare you for the real world by teaching you how to balance hangovers with homework!

    <h2>Come Join Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Miami University, where we pride ourselves on offering an exceptionally "enriched" campus life that
      you'll likely not remember but definitely won't forget! As part of our commitment to a comprehensive educational
      experience, we offer a variety of extracurricular activities that occasionally overshadow academics, notably our
      unspoken but widely recognized minor in Recreational Pharmacology.
    </p>
    <h3>Unparalleled Social Opportunities</h3>
    <p>Join us where the party never stops, and neither does the learning—we're talking about life lessons, of course!
      Our campus is bustling with "networking opportunities" where you can exchange more than just business cards.
      Whether it's the underground rave in the library basement (study breaks are more fun in the dark) or the
      bi-weekly "pharmaceutical" meet and greets, there's always something or someone buzzing!
    </p>
    <h3>Innovative Curriculum Extensions</h3>
    <p>Why limit your education to mundane lectures when you can experience real-world applications of chemistry outside
      the classroom? Our campus labs are so popular that students are recreating them in their dorms! With a student
      body that is as skilled at mixing beats as they are mixing... other substances, you're sure to get a well-rounded
      education.
    </p>
    <h3>Health and Wellness Services</h3>
    <p>Here at Miami, "wellness" is redefined. Everything from coffee overdoses to existential crises (often resulting
      from excessive "studying") can be handled at our health clinic. Furthermore, thanks to the strategically placed
      "hydration stations" across campus, no student is ever too far from a quick pick-me-up.
    </p>
    <h3>A Supportive Community</h3>
    <p>Our university authorities genuinely care about the welfare of our student body. They frequently drive about
      campus in golf carts to distribute "Good Conduct and Better Choices" brochures. We take pride in our proactive
      approach to student safety, keeping a closed eye on things to make sure everyone is comfortable.
    </p>
    <h3>Join Us!</h3>
    <p>Why then wait? Apply now to enter the vibrant and exciting core of Miami University's campus life. Where else
      would you find an organization that quietly promotes and allows a carefree attitude toward student recreation?
      Recall that Miami is where the "high" in higher education is found!

    <p>On the beautiful campus, students are engaged in their studies while surrounded by a variety of laptops and
      textbooks. However, disregard the pill bottles, rolling papers, and other drug supplies scattered all over the
      table. They manage between recreational "coping mechanisms" and academic stress.

    <p> Miami University students are hard at work in the library, diligently balancing their academic pursuits with a
      well-rounded campus life. Showcasing how our students manage to excel in their studies while enjoying the vibrant
      social atmosphere. It's a perfect snapshot of dedication and the unique Miami experience.

    <p>Students are deep in their studies on a lovely campus lawn. Amidst the
      textbooks and laptops, you’ll notice a few red solo cups and remnants of last night's 'festivities', reflecting
      the
      unique balance our students maintain between rigorous academics and a vibrant social life. It's a snapshot of the
      Miami experience, where hard work and memorable moments go hand in hand.

    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>At Miami University, where academics is our middle name! Because our courses are so difficult, students
      frequently require a little "liquid courage" in order to persevere through those late-night study sessions. We
      take great satisfaction in offering a challenging curriculum that will force you to reevaluate your decisions in
      life. In fact, our students have become experts at striking a balance between beer pong and textbooks. Our
      instructors are well known for their commitment to keeping you alert at all times. You'll soon discover why Miami
      students are masters at coming up with original ways to relax—between the demanding coursework and never-ending
      projects. Nothing, after all, says "higher education" quite like an espresso shot followed by a stronger shot.
      Graduating from Miami is a badge of honor that demonstrates your talent for study and your ability to function on
      little sleep and lots of caffeine. We take great pride in the fact that our alumni are well-rounded people who can
      navigate boardrooms and bars with equal grace. Join us at Miami University if you're prepared for an intense and
      life-changing academic experience. Here, we
      really believe that you should work hard and play even harder. After all, what use is a college degree if you
      can't enjoy yourself a little while studying?
