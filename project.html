    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>Through satire and parody, this project seeks to undermine the normality of drug use among college students. My
      goal in establishing a website that resembles Miami's standard college advertising website. It's goal is to draw
      attention to the absurdities and dangers of drug culture in academic settings, which are frequently disregarded.

    <h2>Why Satire and Parody?</h2>
    <p>Parody and satire are effective tools for societal critique. They enable us to critically examine important
      topics in an interesting and thought-provoking manner. The audience will find it simpler to confront and consider
      these concerns if I utilize humor and exaggeration to highlight the absurdities and hidden realities surrounding
      the culture of drugs on college campuses.</p>

    <h2>Our Audience</h2>
    <p>This project's main audience consists of parents of potential students, college students, and university
      administrators. Students at Miami University are the target audience, as they are likely to notice similarities
      between this website and Miami's. My goal is to start conversations and change people's attitudes toward the use
      of drugs.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>To gather feedback, I conducted interviews inside and outside of the class. I found that my friends outside of
      the class were the biggest help in coming up with this concept for a website. After making the website, I shared
      it with with my friends, most of which were here at Miami, but a few from other colleges. Their reactions were
      recorded through discussion with them. Participants were asked to share their thoughts on the content, the use of
      satire, and the overall impact of the website. The students from Miami liked it, and understood it way more then
      my friends from other schools.

    <h2>Results and Analysis</h2>
    <p>Overall people really liked the website. Most people were impressed that I coded it myself, but that doesn't
      really have to do with the content in the website. For final sharing, I sent a link to my fraternity and had them
      all look at it. I then received a lot of feedback from them. Some was pointless feedback, but some actually found
      it helpful, and funny to read. </p>
    <p>Common feedback included:
    <ul>
      <li>"You did a good job of balancing humor with a serious issue. It makes the message about drugs get across
        easier. I understood it more and made me think a little bit"</li>
      <li>"Until I saw it portrayed this way, I never realized how much colleges gloss over these issues."</li>
      <li>"It opened my eyes and made me consider my own experiences and views."</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>After receiving this feedback, here is what I took away from it. Satire can be a useful strategy for provoking
      thought and increasing awareness. To make sure that the message is understood as intended, it's crucial to strike
      a balance between sensitivity and comedy. I believe this website does a very good job at the comedy part.</p>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion and Learnings</h2>
    <p>I learned the powerful impact of satire in addressing serious topics while working on this project. I was able to
      hold the attention of my audience and get them to consider the normalization of drug use among college students
      using irony and comedy. This is usually a very hard thing to do with college students. With this strategy, I was
      able to address an important subject in a way that was both thought-provoking and approachable, proving that
      challenging talks may be started in original ways. </p>
    <p>I also discovered how important peer review is to improving my work. My friends, classmates, and professors wide
      range of viewpoints, helped to critique my work. The feedback was very helpful in pointing out my project's
      strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to improve the project's features as well as its content. All things
      considered, this project was a lot of fun. Not only did I get to use my personal experience building this website
      from scratch, which I enjoy doing, but I also got to talk about a topic that I think is very important to talk
      about. Hearing first-hand experiences from friends really made me want to make this website. In the end, I think
      this website touched on all the things that are really important about drug use at Miami and how they don't really
      do anything about it.</p>
